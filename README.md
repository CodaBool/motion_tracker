# foundry-vtt-module-motion-tracker
A module giving life to the Alien RPG motion tracker in foundry VTT

The module installs a button just over the chat box that you can hit.
When hitted, the button will scan for the next active and visibles tokens based on the selected token.

v0.0.1
If you select another token the display will update.
Moving tokens will update the display also.
Clicking on the button again will hide the motion tracker.
The motion tracker is visible for everyone, there is an option in the settings to only allow having the button for the GM, but it won't update an UI already rendered so you have to kick your players out.
